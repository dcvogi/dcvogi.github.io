description: In this first blog post I will share the topic of the first and only (at the moment) paper I published along with some very distinguished and talented professors and colleagues.

<h2>Background</h2>
During my university years (<a href="http://di.ionio.gr/en/">Ionian University - Department of Informatics</a>), I was always trying to get my hands dirty with as many parts of Computer Science as possible in order to identify what suits me best. This is the process of elimination and is always working for me. I started or participated in projects varying from computer networks to mobile applications and from cloud computing (my thesis) to big data. 
</br></br>
As you can imagine, I chose the winner. Big data always intrigued me and is something I never felt like work. Moreover, working with data is my way to please the curious version of myself and find answers to my questions.
</br></br>
All this time, I had the priviledge of meeting and working with very talented people, many of which I still call friends. With a couple of those, we founded a developers team (Ionian Developers Team) where we developed an Android Application (<a href="https://ionio.gr/gr/news/6265/">Feedippides</a>) to keep our fellow students (and ourselves) up to date with our class announcements or updates. We were also lab members and researchers of the Information Systems and Databases (ISDLab) Lab of the department. As members of the lab, our professor (and one of my mentors on the field) <a href="https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en/staff/faculty/sioutas-spyros">Dr. Spyros Sioutas</a> proposed the idea of writing a survey and publish it on the 2nd International Workshop on Algorithmic Aspects of Cloud Computing (<a href="https://conferences.au.dk/algo16/algocloud/">ALGOCLOUD 2016</a>). In this paper, we had to set up and configure a DHT-based database on a cluster and apply a couple of machine learning algorithms that can run in parallel. Below you can find the abstract of the paper.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

Several solutions have been proposed over the past few years
on data storage, data management as well as data retrieval systems.
These solutions can process massive amount of data stored in relational
or distributed database management systems. In addition, decision making analytics and predictive computational statistics are some of the
most common and well studied fields in computer science. In this paper,
we demonstrate the implementation of machine learning algorithms over
an open-source distributed database management system that can run
in parallel on a cluster. In order to accomplish that, a system architecture scheme (e.g. Apache Spark) over Apache Cassandra is proposed.
This paper also presents a survey of the most common machine learning
algorithms and the results of the experiments performed over a Point-Of-Sales (POS) data set.
